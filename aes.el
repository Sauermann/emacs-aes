;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides support for saving files in an encrypted form
;; by using Cipher-block chaining [4] and Offset Codebook Mode [5].
;; Both use Rijndael [1] as encryption algorithm, which is implemented
;; natively in Emacs.  Rijndael is a superset of the AES algorithm
;; [2].  Additionally this library provides a password generator based
;; on AES and random user input.  For patent issues about OCB see [6],
;; which allows this distribution.

;; Config file
;; Insert "(require 'aes)" into your local .emacs file to load this
;; library.
;; Insert "(aes-enable-auto-decryption)" into yout local .emacs file
;; for convenient automatic recognization of encrypted files during
;; loading.

;; Whenever possible, this library should be used byte-compiled, as
;; this provides a really great performance boost!

;; Main entry points:

;; `aes-encrypt-current-buffer' / `aes-decrypt-current-buffer' Ask for
;; password and encrypt / decrypt current buffer.
;; `aes-insert-password' Generate a random password from user input.

;; For customizing this library, there is the customization group aes
;; in the applications group.

;; Version 24.4 and 24.5 are recommended
;; Version 24.3 should only be used, if the patch described in [11]
;; is applied, because there is a bug that causes passwords to be
;; shown in the minibuffer.
;; Versions 24.1 and 24.2 were not tested.
;; Versions 22 to 23 are recommended.
;; Version 21 and below are no longer supported.

;; This implementation allows additionally to the AES specification
;; blocklengths of 24 and 32 bytes.

;; Nb denotes the number of 32-bit words in the state.
;; Nk denotes the number of 32-bit words comprising the cipher key.
;; Nr denotes the number of rounds.
;; We allow Nb and Nk to be 4, 6, or 8. and Nr = max(Nb, Nk) + 6

;; Since Emacs implements integers as 29 bit numbers, it is not
;; possible to use the optimization, which requires 32 bit numbers.
;; For details see [3].  This leads to an 8-bit design for this
;; implementation.  So the following fitting implementation is used
;; here.
;; - Multiplication and inverting in GF(2^8) are implemented as table
;;   lookups.
;; - The state is implemented as a unibyte string of length 4 * Nb.
;; - Plaintext and ciphertext are implemented as unibyte strings.
;; - The expanded key is implemented as a list of length 4 * Nb * (1 +
;;   Nr) with entries '((A . B) . (C . D)), where A, B, C and D are
;;   bytes.  It is precalculated before the en-/decryption algorithms.
;; - The S-boxes are implemented by lookup tables.
;; - The three operations ByteSub, ShiftRow and MixColumn together
;;   with round-key-addition are implemented in the functions
;;   `aes-SubShiftMixKeys' and `aes-InvSubShiftMixKeys' for encryption
;;   and decryption respectively.
;; - CBC mode is implemented straightforward, using a Zero [12] or
;;   PKCS#7 [7] padding.  The IV is appended to and saved with the
;;   ciphertext.
;; - OCB mode made the implementation of a pmac, based on AES,
;;   necessary, but the further details were straightforward.  The IV
;;   is appended to the ciphertext.  During decryption the created
;;   hash-value is checked.
;; - the function `aes-key-from-passwd' generates an AES key from an
;;   user input string (password).
;; - Further `aes-insert-password' generates random passwords, based
;;   on random user input like mousemovement, time and keyinput.

;; The version of the internal storage format of encrypted data is
;; 1.3.  Version 1.2 will be supported until at least December
;; 2015. But it is advised to load and save all encrypted files using
;; this version

;; The latest version of this package is also available via MELPA [9]
;; and Marmalade [10].

;; There are two [13] other [14] Elisp implementations of AES.

;; Known Bugs / Limitations / TODO:
;; - This implementation is not resistant against DPA attacks [8].
;; - `aes-auto-decrypt' is not completely compliant to Emacs standards.
;; - Handle CBC and OCB in two different functions instead of the
;;   single function `aes-encrypt-buffer-or-string'.
;; - don't handle padding in `aes-cbc-encrypt'.
;; - refactor `aes-user-entropy'
;; - test random number generator
